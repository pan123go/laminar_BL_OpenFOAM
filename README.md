# laminar_BL_OpenFOAM
This is a laminar boundary layer using OpenFOAM's icoFoam solver

The boundary conditions in the U file are...

we have zeroGradinet on the top and bottom of the entrence region.
we have constant velocity on the left side of entrence region.
we have zeroGradient on top of the flat plate region and the right hand side.
we have noslip consition on bottom of flat plate region.
